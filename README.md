# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for a customer churn prediction project. 
The goal of this project is to predict which customers are most likely to churn (i.e., stop doing business with a company) 
so that companies can take action to retain those customers.

Data
The data used in this project is from a fictional telecommunications company and contains information about their customers, 
including demographic information, service usage, and customer account information.It is taken from Kaggle
The data is provided in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/versions/1?resource=download


Code
The code for this project is written in Python and is provided in the code folder. 
The main script is churn_prediction.py, which trains and evaluates several machine learning models for predicting customer churn.


Dependencies
This project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
tensorflow
seaborn
sklearn


Usage
To run this project, follow these steps:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (see above).
Navigate to the code folder and run the churn_prediction.py script.
The script will train several machine learning models and evaluate their performance on the test set. 
The results will be printed to the console and saved to a file in the results folder.

Results
The results of this project are presented in the results folder, 
which contains a file with the performance metrics for each model. 
The best model achieved an accuracy of 77% on the test set.

Contributing
